# KPI’s
1.	Total Bookings – How many trips were booked over a given period?
2.	Total Booking Value – What is the total revenue generated from all bookings?
3.	Average Booking Value – What is the average revenue per booking?
4.	Total Trip Distance – What is the total distance covered by all trips?

# DAHBOARD 2: TIME ANALYSIS
To understand trip patterns based on time, Uber needs to analyse ride demand and trends across different time intervals. This dashboard will help in optimizing operations, pricing, and driver availability.
Global Dynamic Measure (Filters All Charts)
A measure selector will be created for:
✔ Total Bookings
✔ Total Booking Value
✔ Total Trip Distance
This dynamic measure will update all visuals based on user selection.
